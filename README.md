<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created from the link below from F5 Labs, author was Shahnawaz Backer:<br>
[https://www.f5.com/labs/learning-center/demystifying-api-attacks-using-gamification](https://www.f5.com/labs/learning-center/demystifying-api-attacks-using-gamification)

Demystifying API Attacks Using Gamification<br>
Learn about authentication, authorization, and security misconfiguration in API compromises by exploring this capture-the-flag game.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You will set up the practice environment in a Kubernetes cluster (Azure/AWS)

The practice environment consists of two applications:

* sbacker/ctfapi: The quiz website describing the scenario that needs to be pwned
* sbacker/witcherportal: The vulnerable portal for challenged


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Kubernetes cluster in Azure or AWS
* Git or have the yaml files uploaded to your K8s master node

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
